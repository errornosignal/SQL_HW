--Homework 7 – SQL

--1. Write a SELECT statement that returns these columns from the Products table:
-- The ListPrice column
-- The DiscountPercent column
-- A column named DiscountAmount that uses the previous two columns to calculate the discount amount and uses the ROUND function to round the result to 2 decimal places


--2. Write a SELECT statement that returns these columns from the Orders table:
-- The OrderDate column
-- A column that returns the four-digit year that’s stored in the OrderDate column
-- A column that returns only the day of the month that’s stored in the OrderDate column.
-- A column that returns the result from adding thirty days to the OrderDate column.


--3. Write a SELECT statement that returns these columns from the Orders table:
-- The CardNumber column
-- The length of the CardNumber column
-- The last four digits of the CardNumber column
-- When you get that working right, add the column that follows to the result set. This is more difficult because the column requires the use of functions within functions.
-- A column that displays the last four digits of the CardNumber column in this format: XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-1234. In other words, use Xs for the first 12 digits of the card number and actual numbers for the last four digits of the number.


--4. Write a SELECT statement that returns these columns from the Orders table:
-- The OrderID column
-- The OrderDate column
-- A column named ApproxShipDate that’s calculated by adding 2 days to the OrderDate column
-- The ShipDate column
-- A column named DaysToShip that shows the number of days between the order date and the ship date
-- When you have this working, add a WHERE clause that retrieves just the orders for March 2016.
